# SickBeats

SickBeats is a [CodeNetwork](https://www.facebook.com/groups/WeCodeAlot/) group project.

The aim is to create a music-queuing service that is open source, and easily deployable to any venue/home.

The initial prototype will just have Spotify support, however other streaming services will be added in the future as requested, such as Apple 
Music and YouTube.
